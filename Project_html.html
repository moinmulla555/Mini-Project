    <h3> Let's Know More About Big Cats in Details </h3><br>

    <img src="./Assets/big-cats-4s.jpg" height="400px" width="600px">

    <p>The big cats are the four members of the genus panthera. These cats are unique not only in sheer size, but also
        in their ability to roar. A specialized larynx and a unique part of the throat called a hyoid apparatus allows
        for the production of a true, deep roaring sound.

        While the cougar, cheetah, snow leopard and clouded leopard are also fairly large, and occasionally included in
        this group, their larynx creates more of a combination hiss/snarl sound without the bass tone of a real roar.

        The snow leopard has been included in the genus panthera since 2008, but there is some controversy over moving
        them from their own genus, uncia, and many biologists still insist the snow leopard is a separate genus.

        Just as scientific folks debated for years whether a panda was a bear or not, this discussion may have nine
        lives as well.</p>

    <h2><u>Interesting Facts about Big Cats :</u> </h2><br>

    <h3>How many species of wild cats are there?</h3>
    <p>
        While the total number of recognized species of wild cats varies, the eight lineages that make up the Felidae
        family are widely accepted. As of November 2017, the Cat Specialist Group of the International Union for
        Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes 41 species in the family Felidae (including the domestic cat).

        The family Felidae is made up of two subfamilies: Pantherinae which is constituted by the 7 big cats, and
        Felinae which represents the 33 small cats.</p><br>

    <h3>What are the 7 Big cats?</h3>

    <p>
        The 7 Big cats are the large-bodied felids that belong to the subfamily Pantherinae. They are: lion, tiger,
        jaguar, leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard</p><br>

    <h3>What is the rarest wild cat?</h3>

    <p>
        It is difficult to be certain which is the rarest wild cat on Earth because we simply donâ€™t know enough about
        the populations of some of the rarest felids. The Amur leopard is certainly one of the rarest cats with no more
        than 90 individuals surviving in the wild in the Russian Far East</p>
